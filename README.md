# hello-world

This is my first repository in GitHub. I am learning how to create a new repository!

GitHub is a wanderful place for code hosting. I cannot wait to explore it and learn from other guys!

I am majoring in physics, but I am very passionate on CS.

Tomorrow is Qing-Ming festival. Enjoy the holiday!
